# ballistic-trajectory-research-2026
High school physics project (2026): Numerical modeling and experimental analysis of projectile motion with air resistance using Euler method and ballistic pistol experiments. Includes Excel simulations, Python code, and experimental data.
# My First Physics Project
**Ballistic trajectory with air resistance | School 2026**

I'm learning how air resistance affects flying objects using:
- Excel calculations
- School experiment with ballistic pistol
- My first Python code

Files:
- `trajectory.py` - simple Python program
- `calculations.xlsx` - all math
- `experiment/` - photos and data

This is my start in computational physics!
